    "## Hands-on I\n",
    "Let's get started. In this first hands-on, we will work towards making an efficient iterative GPU solver for the forward steady state flow problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✏️ Task 1: Steady-state diffusion problem\n",
    "The first script we will work on is [geothermal_2D_noacc.ipynb](notebooks/geothermal_2D_noacc.ipynb). This script builds upon the [visu_2D.ipynb](notebooks/visu_2D.ipynb) scripts and contains the basic structure of the iterative code and the updated `# numerics` section.\n",
    "\n",
    "As first task, let's complete the physics section in the iteration loop, replacing `# ???` by actual code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once done, let's run the script and briefly check how iteration count normalised by `nx` scales when changing the grid resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✏️ Task 2: The accelerated pseudo-transient method\n",
    "As you can see, the iteration count scales quadratically with increasing grid resolution and the overall iteration count is really large.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this issue, we can implement the accelerated pseudo-transient method [(Räss et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-5757-2022). Practically, we will define residuals for both x and z fluxes (`Rqx`, `Rqz`) and provide an update rule based on some optimal numerical parameters consistent with the derivations in [(Räss et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-5757-2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from the [geothermal_2D.ipynb](notebooks/geothermal_2D.ipynb) script, let's implement the acceleration technique. We can now reduce the cfl from `clf = 1 / 4.1` to `cfl = 1 / 2.1`, and `dτ = cfl * min(dx, dz)^2` becomes now `vdτ = cfl * min(dx, dz)`. Other modifications are the introduction of a numerical Reynolds number (`re = 0.8π`) and the change of `maxiter = 30nx` and `ncheck = 2nx`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's complete the physics section in the iteration loop, replacing `# ???` with actual code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code and check how the iteration count scales as function of grid resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✏️ Task 3: From CPU to GPU using array programming\n",
    "So far so good, we have an efficient algorithm to iteratively converge the elliptic subsurface flow problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to briefly showcase how to port the vectorised Julia code, using array \"broadcasting\", to GPU computing using \"array programming\". As other languages, one way to proceed in Julia is to simply initialise all arrays in GPU memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia will create GPU function during the code compilation (yes, Julia code is actually compiled \"just ahead of time\") and execute the vectorised operations on the GPU. **In this workshop we will use [CUDA.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDA.jl) to target Nvidia GPUs**, but the [Julia GPU](https://juliagpu.org/) ecosystem supports AMD, ARM and Intel GPUs through [AMDGPU.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/AMDGPU.jl), [Metal.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/Metal.jl) and [oneAPI.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/oneAPI.jl), respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following changes are needed to execute the vectorised CPU Julia [geothermal_2D.ipynb](notebooks/geothermal_2D.ipynb) script on a GPU:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Array initialisation need now to be prepended with `CUDA.`, i.e., `Pf = zeros(nx, nz)` becomes `Pf = CUDA.zeros(Float64, nx, nz)`.\n",
    "- Default precision in CUDA.jl is `Float32`, i.e., single precision. To use double precision, one needs to specify `Float64` during initialisation.\n",
    "- Using `CUDA.device!(0)` allows to select a specific GPU on a multi-GPU node.\n",
    "- To avoid \"scalar indexing\", indexing of `Qf` array for well location needs to be updated from `Qf[x_iw, z_w]` to `Qf[x_iw:x_iw, z_w:z_w]` (to make it look like a range).\n",
    "- GPU arrays passed for plotting need to be converted back to host storage first, using `Array()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement those changes in the [geothermal_2D_gpu_ap.ipynb](notebooks/geothermal_2D_gpu_ap.ipynb) script, replacing the `#= ??? =#` comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "These minor changes allow us to use GPU acceleration out of the box. However, one may not achieve optimal performance using array programming on GPUs. The alternative is to use **kernel programming**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 4: Kernel programming\n",
    "In GPU computing, \"kernel programming\" refers to explicitly programming the compute function instead of relying on array broadcasting operations. This permits to explicitly control kernel launch-parameters and to optimise operations inside the compute function to be executed on the GPU, aka kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✏️ Task 4a: CPU \"kernel\" programming\n",
    "For a smooth transition, let's go back to our vectorised CPU code, [geothermal_2D.ipynb](notebooks/geothermal_2D.ipynb). We will now create a version of this code where:\n",
    "1. The physics should be isolated into specific compute functions which will then be called in the iterative loop;\n",
    "2. We will use nested loops (as one would do in C programming) to express the computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general design of a compute function looks as following\n",

    "function compute_fun!(A, A2)\n",
    "    Threads.@threads for iz ∈ axes(A, 2)\n",
    "        for ix ∈ axes(A, 1)\n",
    "            @inbounds if (ix<=size(A, 1) && iz<=size(A, 2)) A[ix, iz] = A2[ix, iz] end\n",
    "        end\n",
    "    end\n",
    "    return\n",
    "end\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note that for analogy with GPU computing, we perform the bound-checking using an `if` statement inside the nested loops and not use the loop ranges._\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia offers \"native\" support for multi-threading. To use it, simply decorate the outer loop with `Threads.@threads` and launch Julia with the `-t auto` or `-t 4` flag (for selecting max available or 4 threads, respectively). In VScode Julia extension settings, you can also specify the amount of threads to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `@inbounds` macro deactivates bound-checking and results in better performance. Note that is recommended to only use it once you have verified the code produces correct results, else you may get a segmentation fault.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start from the [geothermal_2D_kp.ipynb](notebooks/geothermal_2D_kp.ipynb) code and finalise it replacing the `# ???` with more valid content. Note that we introduces macros to perform derivatives and averaging in a point-wise fashion:\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "macro d_xa(A) esc(:($A[ix+1, iz] - $A[ix, iz])) end\n",
    "macro d_za(A) esc(:($A[ix, iz+1] - $A[ix, iz])) end\n",
    "macro avx(A)  esc(:(0.5 * ($A[ix, iz] + $A[ix+1, iz]))) end\n",
    "macro avz(A)  esc(:(0.5 * ($A[ix, iz] + $A[ix, iz+1]))) end\n",
    "```\n",
    "These expression can be called using e.g. `@d_xa(A)` within the code and will be replaced by the preprocessor before compilation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once done, run the code, change the number of threads and check out the scaling in terms of wall-time while increasing grid resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✏️ Task 4b: GPU kernel programming\n",
    "Now that we have a multi-threaded Julia CPU code with explicitly defined compute functions, we are ready to make the final step, i.e., port the [geothermal_2D_kp.ipynb](notebooks/geothermal_2D_kp.ipynb) code to GPU using kernel programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main change is to replace the nested loop, which is where the operations are fully or partly serialised (depend on single or multi-threading execution, respectively). The parallel processing power of GPUs come from their ability to execute the compute functions, or kernels, asynchronously on different threads. Assigning a each grid point in our computational domain to a different GPU thread enables massive parallelisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to replace:\n",
    "```julia\n",

    "## The optimisation problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous session, we have learned how to compute the fluid pressure and fluxes in the computational domain with a given permeability distribution. In many practical applications the properties of the subsurface, such as the permeability, are unknown or poorly constrained, and the direct measurements are very sparse as they would require extracting the rock samples and performing laboratory experiments. In many cases, the _outputs_ of the simulation, i.e. the pressure and the fluxes, can be measured in the field at much higher spatial and temporal resolution. Therefore, it is useful to be able to determine such a distribution of the properties of the subsurface, that the modelled pressures and fluxes match the observations as close as possible. The task of finding this distribution is referred to as _the inverse modelling_. In this session, we will design and implement the inverse model for determining the permeability field, using the features of Julia, such as GPU programming and automatic differentiation.\n",

    "In the following, we will refer to the model that maps the permeability to the pressure and the fluxes as _the forward model_. Opposed to the _forward model_, the inputs of the _inverse model_ are the _observed_ values of the pressure and the fluxes, and the outputs are the distributions of the subsurface properties. The results of the inverse modelling can be then used to run a forward model to check if the modelled quantities indeed match the observed ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define the results of the forward model as the mapping $\\mathcal{L}$ between the subsurface permeability field $K$ and the two fields: the pressure $P$ and the flux $\\boldsymbol{q}$. To describe this mapping, we use the fact that the solution to the system of the governing equations for the pressure makes the residual $R$ to be equal to zero:\n",

    "To quantify the discrepancy between the results of the forward model $\\mathcal{L}$ and the observations $\\mathcal{L}_\\mathrm{obs}$, we introduce the _objective function_ $J$, which in the simplest case can be defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "J(\\mathcal{L}(K); \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{obs}}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\Omega} [\\mathcal{L}(K) - \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{obs}}]^2 \\, \\text{d}\\Omega ,\n",

    "Therefore, the inverse modelling is tightly linked to the field of mathematical optimization. Numerous methods of finding the optimal value of $K$ exist, but in this workshop we will focus on _gradient-based_ methods. One of the simplest gradient-based method is the method of _the gradient descent_.\n",

    "To update $K$, one needs to be able to evaluate the gradient of the objective function $\\mathrm{d}J/\\mathrm{d}K$. The tricky part here is that evaluating the objective function $J$ itself involves a forward model solve $\\mathcal{L}(K)$. The naive approach is to approximate the gradient by finite differences, which requires perturbing the values of $K$ at each grid point and evaluating the objective function $J$. If the computational domain is discretised into $N = n_x \\times n_y$ grid points, computing the gradient requires $N$ forward solves, which is prohibitively expensive even at relatively low resolution. Fortunately, there is a neat mathematical trick which allows evaluating gradient $\\mathrm{d}J/\\mathrm{d}K$ in only one extra linear solve, called _the adjoint state method_.\n",

This is necessary since the permeability in the barrier is 6 orders of magnitude lower that that of the surrounding subsurface. This is characteristic for the Earth's crust. Using the logarithm of the permeability as the control variable makes the inversion procedure much more robust, and avoids accidentally making the permeability negative, with would result in instability.\n",

    "We have two more new functions in the file [geothermal_2D_gpu_kp_ad_inv.ipynb](notebooks/geothermal_2D_gpu_kp_ad_inv.ipynb), namely `loss` and `∇loss!`. \"Loss\" is just another name for the objective function (which is also often called the \"cost function\"). It is obvious that in order to evaluate the loss function, one has to run the forward solver, and to evaluate the gradient, one needs to make the forward solve, followed by adjoint solve, and finally evaluate the gradient. Replace the `#= ??? =#` with corresponding calls to the forward and adjoint solvers, and finally the `∇_residual_fluxes_s!` function.\n",

Many such algorithms are implemented in the package [Optim.jl](https://github.com/JuliaNLSolvers/Optim.jl). Implementations in Optim.jl include automatic search for the step size (`γ` in our code), and improved search directions for faster convergence then just the direction of the steepest descent.\n",
